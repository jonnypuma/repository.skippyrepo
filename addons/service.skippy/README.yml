# 📼 Skippy — The XML-EDL Segment Skipper

Skippy is a Kodi service that intelligently detects and can skip predefined video segments such as intros, recaps, ads, or credits using companion `.xml` or `.edl` files. 

Supports chaptered Matroska XMLs, enhanced EDLs with labeled action types.
 
It provides both automatic and user-prompted skipping, and integrates seamlessly into playback with customizable notifications and dialogs.

Discreet, cross-platform, and customizable.

Supported Video Formats: Works for MKV files.

Known Limitations: MP4 files are currently not supported when the video is played from an NFS share due to a technical limitation in how the add-on attempts to read sidecar files for MP4s over a network protocol.

🎬 Play the Video
Start playback of MyMovie.mkv in Kodi. Skippy will:

1. Searches for XML or EDL metadata file alongside the video.

2. Tries to read .xml first, then .edl as fallback. Parses segment list and stores in memory

3. Matches segment labels

4. Skip, prompt or never ask based on your preferences

5- Show a toast if no segments are found (if enabled)

Each second:
- Checks current time against segment list
- If within an active segment: Applies skip behavior
- Flags as prompted to avoid repeats
- Checks current playback time
- If a matching segment is active and unskipped:
    ⏩ Skips automatically 
    ❓ Prompts the user
    🚫 Does nothing — based on label behavior
- Remembers if a segment is dismissed to avoid repeat prompts (unless user seeks back), i.e. at stop, end, or rewind: clears segment cache and skip history

---

🧪Forced cache clearing
Force cache clearing (reparse segments every time), to avoid Kodi cache remembering what you have skipped if you want to restart a playback for instance.

Done by:
python
monitor.last_video = None

Force prompt for testing:
python
if True:  # triggers skip dialog

🧠 Skip Modes examples
Segment behavior is matched via normalized labels and defined in:

- segment_always_skip
- segment_ask_skip
- segment_never_skip

Examples:

segment_always_skip = commercial, ad
segment_ask_skip = intro, recap, credits, pre-roll
segment_never_skip = logo, preview, prologue, epilogue, main

---

📁 File Support
Skippy supports the following segment definition files:

filename.edl

filename-chapters.xml

filename_chapters.xml

These should reside in the same directory as the video file. EDL files follow Kodi’s native format with start, end, and action code lines. XML files use a chapter-based structure. See section below.

---

🧩 File Example
Breaking.Bad.S01E02.mkv
├── Breaking.Bad.S01E02-chapters.xml or Breaking.Bad.S01E02_chapters.xml    # XML chapter file
└── Breaking.Bad.S01E02.edl                                                 # Fallback if no XML found

XML takes priority if both exist.

---

📁 Metadata Formats
Skippy supports two segment metadata formats, placed alongside the .mkv or video file:

1. ✅ XML Chapter Files (Preferred)
- Filenames: filename-chapters.xml or filename_chapters.xml
- Format: Matroska-style (e.g. exported by Jellyfin)
- Label: `<ChapterString>Intro</ChapterString>`
- Configurable behavior per label: auto-skip / ask to skip / never

2. ✅ Enhanced EDL Files (Fallback)
- Filename: `filename.edl`
- Format: <start_time> <end_time> <action_type> ;label=Intro (or set preferred label in the settings.xml)
- Configurable behavior per label: auto-skip / ask-to-skip / never (shares the same label settings as the xml route)

📄 Sample Segment Files
EDL files define skip segments using three values per line

🧾 .edl File Content Example:
210 235 4 

→ Will skip or prompt from 3:30 to 3:55 if action type `4` is mapped to `'Intro'` 
Format: <start_time> <end_time> <action_type>. start_time and end_time are in seconds. <action type> is an integer between 4 to 99
Action mapping: action_code maps to a label via edl_action_mapping (e.g. 4:intro, 5:credits)


ℹ️ Kodi may log a warning for unknown EDL action types — this is expected and harmless.

Custom action types (4–99) are supported amd configurable via settings:
4 → Segment (default)
5 → Intro
6 → Ad, etc. — 

Optional label support using comments:
42.0 58.3 4 ;label=Intro

If no label is present in edl file or defined in settings, 'Segment' is used as fallback

📘 .xml Chapter Format
XML files define segments using chapter metadata:

xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Chapters>
  <EditionEntry>
    <ChapterAtom>
      <ChapterTimeStart>00:00:00.000</ChapterTimeStart>
      <ChapterTimeEnd>00:01:00.000</ChapterTimeEnd>
      <ChapterDisplay>
        <ChapterString>Intro</ChapterString>
      </ChapterDisplay>
    </ChapterAtom>
    <ChapterAtom>
      <ChapterTimeStart>00:20:00.000</ChapterTimeStart>
      <ChapterTimeEnd>00:21:00.000</ChapterTimeEnd>
      <ChapterDisplay>
        <ChapterString>Credits</ChapterString>
      </ChapterDisplay>
    </ChapterAtom>
  </EditionEntry>
</Chapters>
ChapterString is the label used for skip mode matching

Times must be in HH:MM:SS.mmm format

Labels are normalized (e.g. Intro, intro, INTRO all match)

🧩 File Example
Breaking.Bad.S01E02.mkv
├── Breaking.Bad.S01E02-chapters.xml or Breaking.Bad.S01E02_chapters.xml    # XML chapter file
└── Breaking.Bad.S01E02.edl                                                 # Fallback if no XML found

XML takes priority if both exist.

✅ Segment Behavior Logic Summary
Behavior	Dialogs Enabled (show_dialogs = True)	Dialogs Disabled (show_dialogs = False)
never	            ❌ Skip silently	                            ❌ Skip silently
ask	                ✅ Show dialog	                                ❌ Suppress dialog
auto	            ✅ Skip automatically	                        ✅ Skip automatically

If show_skip_dialog_movies = False, then dialogs will be suppressed for movie segments even if their behavior is "ask".

If show_skip_dialog_episodes = False, then dialogs will be suppressed for episode segments with "ask" behavior.

This suppression is independent of the segment file presence or toast settings.

✅ Example
If a segment in a movie has behavior "ask" and show_skip_dialog_movies = False, the dialog will not appear. Instead, the segment will be silently skipped or ignored depending on other settings.

🚀 Usage Examples
✅ Auto-skip
If your chapters.xml contains:

<ChapterString>Intro</ChapterString>

And you've configured "Intro" to auto-skip, the addon will jump past it without prompting.

❓ Ask to skip
If your .edl file contains:

0.0 90.0 9
And action code 9 maps to "Recap", and "Recap" is mapped to the "Ask to skip" setting, you'll be prompted to skip it.


🔕 Never skip example
If your segment label is "Credits" and you've mapped "Credits" to the "Never skip" setting, playback continues uninterrupted with no skip popup.

---

🍿 Toast Notification Behavior
- Appears when a video has no matching skip segments


Cooldown enforced per playback session (default: 6 seconds)

- Resets on video stop or replay after cooldown

---

### 🎛️ EDL Action Filtering

Skippy supports optional filtering of Kodi-native EDL action types (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`). This allows users to ignore internal skip markers and rely only on custom-defined segments.

#### 🔧 Setting
- **Name:** `ignore_kodi_edl_actions`
- **Type:** Boolean
- **Default:** `true`

#### ✅ Behavior
| Setting Value | Action Types Parsed | Result |
|---------------|---------------------|--------|
| `true`        | Only custom actions (`>=4`) | Internal Kodi skip markers are ignored |
| `false`       | All action types     | Autoskip or prompt for all segments, including Kodi-native ones |

#### 📝 Example
```edl
237.5    326.326    5    intro
1323.45  1429.184   2    segment

🔁 Skip Overlapping Segments
Skippy now supports configurable overlap detection to help avoid redundant or conflicting skips. This feature ensures that segments which overlap in time are handled according to your preference.

⚙️ Setting: Skip overlapping segments
Location: settings.xml → Segment Settings

Type: Boolean toggle (true / false)

Default: true

🧠 What It Does
When enabled, Skippy will skip any segment that overlaps with one already accepted. This is useful when:

EDL or chapter files contain redundant entries

Multiple tools or sources generate overlapping metadata

You want to avoid double prompts or conflicting skips

📊 Example
Given the following segments:

Segment A: 45.5 → 133.175
Segment B: 50.0 → 100.0
Segment C: 1416.45 → 1507.59
Segment B overlaps with Segment A:

Overlap window: 50.0 → 100.0

Overlap duration: 50.0 → 100.0 (50 seconds)

Percent overlap of Segment B: 100%

Behavior:
Setting Value	Result
true	Segment B is skipped
false	Segment B is kept
🧪 How to Test
Enable verbose logging in settings.

Toggle Skip overlapping segments on/off.

Observe logs like:

⚠ Overlapping segment detected: 50.0–100.0 overlaps with 45.5–133.175
🚫 Skipping overlapping segment: 50.0–100.0 | label='segment'

---

🚨 Logging
Verbose logging reveals:

- Parsed segments and labels
- Playback state and detection
- Toast decision logic and suppression
- Skip dialog flow and user choice
- Enable via enable_verbose_logging for full insight.

---

🔄 Batch EDL Action Type Normalizer (Windows)
Located in tools/edl-updater.bat:

Updates all .edl files under a folder recursively

Replaces old action types with new ones (e.g. 3 → 4)

User can specify which action type to look for and which action type to replace with in accordance with user specifications in the settings.xml file.

Ensures full compatibility with Skippy’s behavior mappings
